-   Rust is a Compiled Language
-   Cargo
-   Rust variables are inmutable by default. to make variable mutable add mut before variable name.
-   Rust has a strong, static type, but has type inference.
-   Shadow values to overwrite previous value with new one.
-   match looks like pattern matching.
-   Shadow vs mut.
-   Tuples (has Destructuring) every unit of tuple has his own type (Fixed Length).
-   Data Types: Integers, Floating Points, booleans, characters, Tuple, Array.
-   Integer Overflow
-   Array (Fixed length).
-   Statements and Expressions (Careful semicolon ;).
-   Garbage collector vs OwnerShip.
-   Stack and Heap.
-   OwnerShip Rules.
-   String ownership.
-   clone().
-   Shallow copy vs Deep Copy.
-   Traits Copy for basic data types.
-   OwnerShip and Functions (Careful).
-   References (pass ownership without return) && Borrowing(Create a reference).
-   Mutable references.
-   Dangling references.
-   String slices.
-   Structs.
-   Struct update syntax (..)
-   Remember ownership when update struct applies.
-   Unit Like Structs, Tuple Structs.
-   Methods, self and Associated functions.
-   Enums, Option Enum vs Null values.
-   Option<T> Enum.
-   Pattern matching.
-   Catch all pattern.
